# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:** Avoiding Rust Deadlocks via Visualizing Lifetime

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Rust is a new programming language designed to provide both safety guarantees like high-level languages and performance guarantees like low-level languages. To achieve this design purpose, Rust leverages static compiler checks to rule out severe memory and thread safety issues during compilation. At runtime, Rust behaves like C/C++ and provides performance as good as C/C++. Due to its safety and performance, Rust is increasingly adopted to build safety-critical software, such as OSes and browsers. Rust is also used to implement many software systems in the Web3 technology stack (e.g., substrate, polkadot, ink!).

Rust’s compiler checks are based on a suite of ownership and lifetime rules. The basic rule allows one value to only have one owner variable, and the value is dropped (freed) when its owner variable ends its lifetime. Rust extends the basic rule to allow ownership to be moved and borrowed, but still guarantees all accesses to a value are within its owner variable’s lifetime scope. Besides safety checks, lifetime is also used for automated resource management. For example, there is no explicit Unlock() in Rust. A locking function call returns a reference of the protected variable, and when the reference ends its lifetime, Rust automatically releases the acquired lock (by implicitly calling Unlock()) to avoid lock-without-unlock bugs in C/C++. 

However, Rust’s lifetime rules are unique and complex. It is challenging for Rust programmers to infer where a variable’s lifetime ends. Therefore, it is not uncommon for them to incorrectly identify the location where an implicit unlock is called. When a lock is held longer than programmers’ expectation, the same lock may be acquired again or a different lock may be acquired before releasing the acquired lock, leading to double-lock deadlocks or deadlocks due to acquiring locks in conflicting orders. 

In our previous work, we conducted an empirical study on real-world Rust concurrency bugs. We inspected GitHub commit logs for five Rust applications and five Rust libraries to collect previously fixed concurrency bugs. In total, we found 37 deadlocks due to misunderstanding where the implicit Unlock() is called, including 30 double locks and seven deadlocks caused by acquiring locks in conflicting orders. Those deadlocks constitute almost all lock-related concurrency bugs (37/38) in our collection. They are all from famous Rust software systems (e.g., Servo, Parity-Ethereum, TiKV, Redox), and severely hurt the reliability of those systems before being fixed. 

  
<ins>A brief description of the project.</ins> 
We propose to build an IDE tool for visualizing the lifetime scope of a user-selected variable. We believe our tool can help Rust programmers avoid deadlocks at the development stage. After writing a piece of code involving a mutex, a programmer can select the return value of a locking operation or the locking operation itself (when the return is not saved to a variable). Our tool will visualize the lifetime scope of the return value (i.e., the critical section). The programmer can then inspect whether the end of the critical section is expected. In addition, our tool will conduct deadlock detection for the selected critical section and provide detailed debugging information for identified bugs, such as highlighting locking operations or function calls leading to locking operations.

<ins>How our tool will be integrated into Substrate/Polkadot?</ins>
Both Substrate and Polkadot are implemented in Rust. Previously, double locks or deadlocks due to acquiring locks in conflicting orders were identified and fixed in Substrate [1, 2]. After applying our prototype, we identified four previously unknown double locks in Substrate or the dependent libraries of Substrate/Polkadot. We reported detected bugs. All of them were confirmed and fixed by developers [3, 4, 5]. We believe our tool can prevent Substrate/Polkadot programmers from making similar mistakes again in the future.   
 

<ins>Why are we interested in creating this project?</ins>
We are interested in building the tool due to three reasons. First, our previous empirical study shows that deadlocks due to misunderstanding Rust’s lifetime rules are common in Rust programs. Visualizing lifetime can avoid these bugs during development, benefiting the whole Rust community. Second, misunderstanding Rust’s lifetime rules can also cause memory bugs, such as use-after-free and double free. Thus, the proposed tool has the potential to combat memory bugs. Third, the experience of building the proposed tool can inspire similar tools for other programming languages featuring lifetime (e.g., Kotlin).

### Project Details 

We have built a prototype of the proposed tool. We published a demonstration paper at this year’s CCS to describe the prototype. The paper can be found [ere]ttps://songlh.github.io/paper/vr.pdf) We also recorded a video to explain the prototype, and the video can be found [here](ttps://youtu.be/L5F_XCOrJTQ)

We applied the bug detection component of the prototype to Substrate, Polkadot, and ink!. We found four previously unknown deadlocks. One is in Substrate. The other three are in the dependent libraries of Substrate or Polkadot. We reported all the detected bugs. All of them were fixed by developers based on our reporting. The information of the detected bugs is listed as follows:

## Future Plans

In the future, we plan to extend the proposed tool along two directions.

First, we will extend the proposed tool to cover memory bugs. Our previous empirical study showed that there are also memory bugs due to misunderstanding Rust’s lifetime rules, such as use-after-free bugs and double-free bugs. The proposed tool has the potential to help Rust programmers avoid these bugs. Of course, we need to explore what program elements should be visualized for memory bugs. 

Second, we will conduct a survey to understand what challenges are faced by programmers when understanding Rust’s lifetime rules and whether the proposed tool can really help them avoid deadlocks. The survey results will guide us to improve the proposed tool, and broadly speaking, the evolution of Rust.
